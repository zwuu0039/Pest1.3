# Pest Quest Readme V1.0Pest Quest is a website designed to improve the awareness of pests that exists in Victoria. This is achieved in multiple ways:* An introductory page that introduces multiple different type of species of pests that exists in Victoria* A map that has marked locations of pests that has appeared in Victoria## MotivationThe motivation behind Pest Quest is because nearly a fifth of Australians do not know how to differentiate between native animals and introduced pests.

However, the reality is such that these pest causes a huge damage to the biodiversity in Australia. ## Requirements* Knowledge in ASP.NET MVC 5 and C#* Microsoft Visual Studio 2019* GitHub (for version control)## Installation Steps1.
